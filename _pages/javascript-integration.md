Material Components Kit is an SCSS library. Hence, it doesn't provide any JavaScript. However, noting that
[MDC Web is aimed to be integrated into any web frameworks](https://material.io/components/web/docs/framework-integration/),
Material Components Kit follows the same goal.

Currently, there is a verified compatibility with Vue.js and [vue-mdc-adapter](https://stasson.github.io/vue-mdc-adapter).
