Material Kit is an SCSS library. Hence, it doesn't provide any JavaScript. However, noting that
[MDC-Web is aimed to be integrated into any web frameworks](https://material.io/components/web/docs/framework-integration/),
Material Kit follows the same goal.

Currently, there is a verified compatibility with Vue.js and [vue-mdc-adapter](https://github.com/stasson/vue-mdc-adapter).
