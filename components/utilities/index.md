Utility classes provide an easy way to adjust such element properties as text-alignment,
visibility, margin and padding.

Utility classes are short and follow slightly modified BEM naming pattern: `mk-{block}--{modifier}`,
where `{block}` is an abbreviation of CSS property and `{modifier}` is a full-length word for that
property's value.
